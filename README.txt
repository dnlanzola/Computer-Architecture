To run and execute the MIPS program code:

Have the Mars client along with the MIPS program photomips.asm and the .bmp files found in the submitted zip file for the project all placed in the same directory. To execute the photomips.asm program, first compile and then run the MIPS program. You will be first prompt to input the name of the .bmp file you wish to modify and then you will be prompt to enter a name (for example out.bmp) to output the modification to the .bmp file you entered previously. Next, a menu will be appear displaying all the filter types. After choosing the specifc filter type you wish to apply, you will see a submenu that displays more options to choose from that relates to the filter type chosen. If you happen to accidentally chose the wrong filter type, there is an option in the submenu of the filter type that allows you to go the previous menu. Once the filter type is chosen, the photomips.asm program is finished. Go the same directory of the input .bmp file you entered and you will see the name of the output .bmp file generated with the specific filter modification apply to the input .bmp file you specified.
